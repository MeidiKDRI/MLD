# Machine Learning Plateform
MLP is a plateform allowing users to perform machine learning without any line of code !  
MLP is a web application using Flask Python web app framework.  

## The Concept :
The main purpose of MLP is to allow a user without a large knowlegde of machine learning to try some models and concepts. Directly in the MLP console, without code.  

After a connection to the plateform member area, the user is able to import and explore a dataset inside **'Data Exploration'** and **'Data Visualization'** pages.  

Then, the user will be able to try one or several models, evaluate and compre them in **'Model Training'** page.  

In the **'Model Prediction'** area, it gonna be easy to make a prediction and export the model.

Login and Sign Up button will be there for connection and subscription.
- Login page.
- Sign-Up page.
- Plateform :  
The main page will be a large and unique page with anchors sending user to differents parts.  
Data Exploration, Data Visualization, Model Training, Model Prediction, Model export.

## Les features :
- Member area : Authentication with Firebase.  
- Dataset .csv Import.  
- Dataframe display.  
- Dataframe cleaning : describes() / NA treatment / Add or remove columns...
- Data Visualization : hist(df), seaborn, matplotlib, Correlation matrix...  
- Models selection, training and evaluation with some metrics...  
- Prediction : Cross validation, ROC curve, Confusion Matrix...

## Done
